# Sorting_Visualizer

This is my attempt at the all too common sorting algorithm visualizer. Of course its written in c++ with SFML.
A x64 exe is in the zip file, idk how to compile a different one.

This version is multithreaded!, this allows the sorting algorithms to run independent of the framerate.

Have fun!

I might add the comparisons and access counters later...
