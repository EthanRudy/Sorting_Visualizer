# Sorting_Visualizer

This is my attempt at the all too common sorting algorithm visualizer. Of course its written in c++ with SFML.

This version is multithreaded!, this allows the sorting algorithms to run independent of the framerate.

Most recent build is in the builds folder. Release build is wacky so I just have the debug

Things to note. 
    - It is windows platform dependent (I think, aka., All I have is source code and a.exe)
    - Still working on it
